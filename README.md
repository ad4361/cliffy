# Why did I make Cliffy?
The translated short story "The Last Voyage of the Ghost Ship" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is just one sentence long. The catch is that the sentence is 2,156 words long. I read the story while on a plane, eyebrows climbing higher up my forehead in surprise as I flipped page after page with no period, exclamation point, or question mark in sight. It was the literary equivalent of holding my breath underwater.

Syntactically, there was a whole lot going on in that sentence of over two thousand words. But really, there's a whole lot going on syntactically in every sentence, even in the short ones. Isn't it incredible that for most of us, we're able to speak our first language fluently and correctly without much thought at all? Isn't it incredible that we learn to speak our first language before we even learn its rules, that we somehow _understand_ these rules without consciously knowing what they explicitly are?

In high school I loved English classes, and I loved writing. Before I was ever a programmer, I was a writer, and I lived for those grammar worksheets. My sophomore year English teacher used to write long sentences on the whiteboard (thankfully nothing so long as "The Last Voyage of the Ghost Ship"), and she would make us label each word's part of speech. Every sentence was a puzzle waiting to be solved, and I always enjoyed solving them. English has a lot of strange and inexplicable edge cases, I know, but for me that's part of the fun.

But my passion for English was largely separate from my passion for computer science. Nothing had ever really happened to bridge that gap, and so it remained unbridged â€” until July 2022, when I found a programming book at a bookstore: _Natural Language Processing with Python and spaCy_ by Yuli Vasiliev. I had never heard of natural language processing or spaCy before, but I knew Python and I knew what a natural language was, so I opened up the book and started reading. By the end of the first chapter I was hooked. NLP felt so tailor-made for me I could barely believe it. Teaching a computer to "understand" and "speak" a language absolutely fascinated me. I read through the whole book in about a month, highlighting and writing in the margins of nearly every single page. 

Cliffy, my first chatbot, is a result of all of these things combined, and is very much a labor of love. I have a great deal left to learn about NLP, but already I have learned so much from Cliffy and, of course, from the book that introduced me to NLP in the first place.
